# Mp3_Tagger_Songs_DB
Java Software Platform Indipendent written to manage mp3 tags on mp3 files, and much more.
For example, you can create and manage a Database, you can easily rename files, optimize a CD
occupation before masterizing it (through a 'Knapsack algorithm' development).

Source files, images and documentation have been uploaded, classes should be generated through Java.
This software has been written by me in 2001-2002. A package with the software can be downloaded easily 
through "Tagger.jar", you should be simply able to double click on it to launch it, even on windows.
