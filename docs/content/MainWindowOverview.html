<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Main Window</font></h1>
Using the main window you can scan all the directories that contain the files of your interest, because they need to be renamed or tagged, and you can receive useful warnings that are based on the parameters contained in the option window.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Directory Browser</font></h2>
The directory browser lays on the left side of the main window. When you start "Mp3 Studio" for the first time, you will see the program directory.<p>
On the top of the panel there's a combo box in which you can insert
the directories where you usually place your files. If you have more
than one partition on your hard disk, you will probably find useful to
insert them here to quickly jump from one directory to another one. Simply click on the <B>"add" button</B> to insert the current directory in the combo box.<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>Remember to keep pressed "SHIFT" or "CTRL" keys
while clicking with your mouse to select more than one directory at a
time. You can also rename the directories: clicking on a node, wait a
moment and do another mouse-click: type the new name and press "RETURN"</B></font><p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Scan and reload buttons</font></h2>
Press the <B>"scan dir" button</B> to scan the directories you have selected
in the left panel. If no directory has been selected, the current directory will be scanned.<p>
The files with the correct extension, depending by what you have
inserted in the option window, will appear in the table on the right.
In the panel placed in the bottom of the window will appear the
warnings, depending again by the values you have inserted in the option window.
If you have opened the rename (or tag) window and you have finished
your rename (or tagging) operations on the selected files, you can go
back to the main window, scan other directories and press the
<B>"reload" button</B> to load the new scanned or selected files in
the rename (or tagging) window.
<h2><font color=#ff6600>Scanned files table</font></h2>
The files you have selected in the last scanning operation are listed in the table on the right side of the window. You can select some of the listed files to operate only on the files you have selected. Press the <B>path radio buttons</B> to change the way the names are listed in the table (you can view the file name, or the file's parent directory or the file's full path).
