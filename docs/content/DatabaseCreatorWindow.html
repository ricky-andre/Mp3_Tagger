<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Database Creator Window</font></h1><p>
This is one of the most important windows, and the reason for which this program was born! Using this window you can create and keep updated a beautiful database with all your mp3 songs and all the information you want. You can order your existing database by artist, by album, by title, by file name or by a combination of them.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Fields selection</font></h2><p>
On the top of the panel, you can select what fields have to be put in
your database list. The fields are placed one after the other, in the
same order they are listed in the table, and with the <B>field
separator</B> character placed between them. You can change the order
by selecting the fields on the table and pressing the <B>"move up"</B>
or <B>"move down"</B> arrows.<p>
You can even add an editable <B>"user field</B>" value: just double
click on it to change the pre-defined value. It is very useful to
store the CD identifier, and this is the reason for which this field
was introduced, but you can use it to write what you want. The only
limitation is that the "user field" cannot contain the separator
character, nor any other field-word ("artist", "title", "song length"
and so on ...), since this could give problems to the database updates
and expansions. When I will later explain how the database is created
and updated you will understand the reason for that. In any case don't
worry about that because "Mp3 Studio" will warn you if you make any
configuration mistake.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Field separator</font></h2><p>
The <B>"field separator"</B> separates the selected fields between
them. It is quite an important string, and it should be a string that
is never contained inside the fields values. You should choose an
uncommon character such as ";" or "%". <font color=#0000CC><B>I strongly recommend you to
choose the tab character ("\t") that is the predefined value</B></font>. It
will be very easy to load up the database list with other programs
such as "Excel" or "Star Office" if you make this choice.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Database and recursion options</font></h2><p>
The <B>database and recursion</B> options are quite easy to be
understood and are very similar to the same values described in the winamp
window<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Order output list options</font></h2><p>
Let's now examine the <B>"order output list options"</B>. You can
select if you want to order the output database list, and you can
choose between 4 ordering criteria: by artist, by album, by title, by
year or by file name. Simply select what you want in the combo boxes and
select them from left to right with the same order with which the
ordering actions have to be taken. Remember that in any case you can
perform ordering operations on the database also in the "Database window".<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Database table</font></h2><p>
In the bottom table appear the database files that are going to be
created, with the directories to which they are referred, the "output
path" and the "output name". You can edit the output database path and
the output database name. On the output database column will appear a
combo box, you can write the directory inside it and the next time you
can choose it again from there.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Operation description</font></h2><p>
Now I will describe you the operations that "Mp3 Studio" will perform
when you will click on the "execute" button.<p>

<ol>
<li>First "Mp3 Studio" checks if an there is an existing database, that means if there is a file in the "output file dir" directory with the same name you have typed in the bottom table.</li>
<li>If you didn't select any directory in the left panel, and you
didn't select the reorder database option, "Mp3 Studio" will warn you
that there is nothing to do, and will tell you to select a directory
or to select the reorder option if you want to reorder the
database.</li>
<li>If you didn't select any directory in the left panel, and the
reorder option is selected, "Mp3 Studio" reads the existing database if
it exists, and reorders the rows depending from the ordering criterias
you have inserted.</li>
<li>If some directories have been selected on the left panel, the
program scans the selected directories (and subdirectories if you
selected recursion checkbox), retrieves the fields you have selected,
and creates a new temporary database. <font color=#0000CC><B>If a
database already exists with the specified name, this database is
expanded, the new selected
songs are added to it, the new expanded database is reordered if you
selected the "order output list"  checkbox, and the new database is
eventually written to disk</B></font>. Moreover, "Mp3 Studio" warns you if the old
database contains more fields than what you have now selected, and
reorders the old database so that the columns order is the same you
have selected now.</li>
<li>If some directories have been selected on the left panel and the
database does not already exist, the scanned songs are reordered (if
you selected to do it), and the new database is written to disk.</li>
</ol>

Do not worry if it seems a bit complicated, it's just an impression.
<font color=#0000CC><B>I strongly recommend you to create a directory in
which you will put your database, and sometimes do some backup copy of
it.</B></font> Try to select some directories and create a new
database. Then change the selected fields, the order of the fields, the user
field value, and expand the database. The best way to understand how
things work is to try.<p>
In every case "Mp3 Studio" will open a window in which it
will warn you about the operation it is doing, and it will describe you
the errors that occur. Everything will become more clear if you just
try to use these features.<p>

The database produced is simply a text file. The first row describes
what are the present columns: for example if the field separator is ";"
(this is used only because it is more practice to do this example, but
remember that the best thing is to use the "tab" character!), and you
have selected the fields "artist", "song length", "user field",
"album", "title" in this order, the first row in the database will be
the following one:<p>

<B>"artist;song length;user field;album;title"</B><p>

Then will follow all the information about the files. You can open
this file with a text editor.<p>
If you already have created your database, you can put it in the
format I described to you to use "Mp3 Studio" to expand it. Remember
to add the first row that describes the column values.<p>
Remember that when you select tag fields, to create the database "Mp3
Studio" reads them in the order you have choosen in the option window:
it reads tag version 2 before tag version 1 if you have selected this
option or viceversa. If the first read value is empty (or contains
only spaces), it reads the second one.<p>

<font color=#0000CC><B>Remember also to read
everything about the advanced database window: it is a powerful
feature that lets you retrieve the tags from the file names or the
folder names if the tags are no present on the file!.</B></font><p>
