<h1 align=left><font color=#ff6600>Bugs and limitations</font></h1>

Up to now there are no bugs, since all bugs discovered by me and by my
friend have been fixed. Some will arise only when this program will be
widely used by you. In any case thousands of files have been tagged
without problems and no file has never been damaged.<p>

Other limitations are the following:<p>

<ul>
<li> if an mp3 file is shorter than 20 Kbytes, it is not considered as
an mp3 file. This is due to the fact that it is needed a minimum length to
find the synchronization and to be sure that the file is an mp3 one (
... don't wanna tag your html files or your images, so that's the
reason of it). In any case it is very hard to find mp3 files shorter
than 20 Kbytes, and even if you find them probably they are not songs,
so you don't need to tag them!</li>
<li> memory does not seem to be a problem for this program, as I tried
it with only 32 Mbytes of RAM and windows 95, and everything worked
fine. In any case, you will need more memory if you have to manage
large database files.</li>
<li> the database window manages text files. I had no problems in
reordering a database file of 2 Megabytes, but I don't know what are
the real length limitation, since they depend also by the system
memory, by the applications you have opened and so on.</li>
</ul>

<font color=#0000CC><B>Remember that it is possible to increase the
memory used by launching "Mp3 Studio" with the -mxNm parameter (for
example -mx60m tries to reserve 60 megabytes of memory).</B></font>
