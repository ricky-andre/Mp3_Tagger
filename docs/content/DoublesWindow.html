<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Doubles Window</font></h1><p>
This window stays on the top-half side of the "other" tabbed pane of
the "Utils window".<p>
This panel lets you select some directories or some database files in
which you want to search if you have some doubled songs. It could be
very useful when one of your friends gives to you his database or a
CD, and you want to keep only the songs you don't already have in your
compilation. This avoids the problem of having lots of duplicated
songs, that is a quite common thing if you have lots of CDs. <p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Double window options</font></h2>
You can select the <B>"recurse subdirectories"</B> and the
<B>"apply advanced search"</b> option. Before choosing to apply the
advanced search, read carefully the description of this
feature inside the "Database creator window" help files.<p>
The <B>"search doubles inside database file"</B> function is useful to
search for possible duplicated songs inside the same directories or
inside the same database file.
Use the <B>"add file"</B> and <B>"remove file"</B> to select the
databases that have to be processed and inspected. If you select more
than one database file, "Mp3 Studio" will search for doubles between
all the possible couples of databases.<p>
You can save the list of the doubled songs on a file, by selecting the
<B>"save output list"</B> checkbox.
Press the <B>"try"</B> button to execute the search.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Doubles search results</font></h2>
<font color=#0000CC><B>"Mp3 Studio" uses an algorithm to find out the
possible duplicated songs. It can sometimes fail and give you false
matches, but I think that it is better than having less matches than
what it should be in reality.</B></font> This means that "Mp3 Studio"
does not limit itself on selecting files that have an identical
"artist" and "title" field, but uses a more complicated algorithm to
face some common problems, such as the leading "the " before the
artist's name ("the beatles" is considered equal to "BEATLES").<p>
A table will appear with the duplicated song list. If the file resides
on the hard disk, a button will appear in the table so that you can
easily delete it (of course, after an "are you sure?" question
...). If the file was found inside a text database file, and the "file
name (full path)" column was found, "Mp3 Studio" will create the
delete button also for these kind of files (if the full path is an
existent one!).<p>

<font color=#0000CC><B>Avoiding to keep lots of songs you
already have will help you in saving space (on your CD or on your hard
disk) and in giving you a more precise idea of how many songs you
REALLY have in your collection!</B></font>
