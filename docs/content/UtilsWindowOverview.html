<li><font color=#0000CC><B>Winamp window:</B></font> create lots of winamp
list files with only a few clicks!</li>

or reorder your database writing inside it all the fields you want.</li>
<li><font color=#0000CC><B>Organizer window:</B></font> reorganize
your mp3 files with a simple click, creating genre directories,
artist subdirectories and so on.</li>

under control your doubled songs, or you will never know how really
big is your collection.</li>
<li><font color=#0000CC><B>CD optimizer window:</B></font> select the
CD space and prepare the selected directories in the right folders to be later
on put on a new created CD, optimizing space and avoiding to loose
