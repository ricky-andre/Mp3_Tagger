<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Advanced Mass Tag Window</font></h1>
In this window you can select what kind of fields, introduced with tag
version 2, you want to write/clear/delete on the files selected in the
main window.<p>
Since this window is full of fields and icons, you can save the selected
configuration by clicking on the <B>"save"</B> button and writing the
file name. The written file name will appear in the combo box to be
later on selected. Click on the <B>"delete"</B> button to remove the
selected configuration file.<p>
There are two possible operative modes in which this window works:

<ul>
<li>when in the mass tag window the "mass tag" operation has been
selected, type in the fields you want to write. To do this you have to
be sure that the icon on the right side is selected and shows the word
"yes". <U>Only the fields with the "yes" icon selected will be written!</U></li>
<li>if you selected to do a "clear" operation in the "mass tag"
window, you cannot write nothing new and you can only select what kind
of fields you want to clear. This is done to avoid unwanted
results. <U>Only the fields with the "yes" icon selected will be cleaned!</U></li>
</ul>

<font color=#0000CC><B>If you stay for a little while over the field,
a tip text can appear to explain you how the field has to be filled to
be accepted and correctly written. If you want to have more detailed info about
a specific tag version 2 field, you can also search in the "index" help panel.</B></font>
