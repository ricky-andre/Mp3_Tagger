<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Organizer Window</font></h1><p>
This panel lets you reorganize your files in directories and
subdirectories with a name that is given by the tag values.<p>
As usual, the best way to explain things is an example.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Reorganization example</font></h2>
Suppose that you have a lot of directories inside the
following directory:<p>

<font color=#006600>"c:\Documenti\Music\"</font><p>

All the directories have the same name format, something like this:<p>

<font color=#006600>"Bon Jovi - These Days"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"Green Day - Compilation"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"Mauro Picotto - Trance 2002"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"DJ Parade 2002 - Compilation"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"U2 - Achtung Baby"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"U2 - Rattle And Hum"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"U2 - The Joshua Tree"</font><p>

... and many others.<p>
Suppose now that you don't want to have music of a lot of different
types in the same root directory (for example disco music in the same
directory of rock music). Moreover, you
want to change the directory names so that if you have a lot of albums
of the same artist, the release year is included in the directory
name, so that you can order the artist's albums from the oldest to the
newest one. The directory structure should be something like this:

<ul>
  <li>
    <font color=#006600>"genre"</font>
    <ul>
       <li>
       <font color=#006600>"artist"</font>
       <ul>
       <li><font color=#006600>"artist - year - album"</font></li>
       </ul>
       </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

These are the string matches you should select in the "Organizer
window".<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Reorganize window options</font></h2>
Select the fields you are interested to on the top of the window, and
press the <B>"add string"</B> button to add the string listed in the text field.
You can also <B>edit</B> the match string before adding it to the
list, to insert fixed fields.
<p>When you have something like the configuration of the example,
on the left panel select the directories you want to reorganize.<p>
On the bottom of the window, select if you want
the files to be <B>copied</B> or <B>moved</B>, and select the starting
directory where all the selected files have to be reorganized. As in
most of the other panels, you can even choose the <B>"recurse
subdirectories"</B> and and the <B>"apply advanced search"</b> option.
Before choosing to apply the advanced search, read carefully the description of this
feature inside the "Database creator window" help files.<p>
Press the <B>"try"</B> button to have a preview of the way the
selected files will be reorganized.<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>If you press the try button, no file will be
moved nor copied anywhere.</B></font> "Mp3 Studio" will read the
tags from the selected directories, <font color=#0000CC><B>only from
the files that have ".mp3" extension (not case sensitive)</B></font>,
and will show with a directory tree where the files will be moved or
copied.<p>

In the above example, if all the files have correct tags, you will see
that the main directory would be reorganized in the following way:
<ul>
<li><font color=#006600>"Rock"</font>
  <ul>
      <li><font color=#006600>"Bon Jovi"</font>
      <ul>
      <li><font color=#006600>"Bon Jovi - 1998 - These Days"</font></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><font color=#006600>"Green Day"</font>
      <ul>
      <li><font color=#006600>"Green Day - 2000 - Compilation"</font></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><font color=#006600>"U2"</font>
      <ul>
      <li><font color=#006600>"U2 - 1992 - Achtung Baby"</font></li>
      <li><font color=#006600>"U2 - 1987 - Rattle And Hum"</font></li>
      <li><font color=#006600>"U2 - 1986 - The Joshua Tree"</font></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><font color=#006600>"Disco"</font>
  <ul>
      <li><font color=#006600>"Mauro Picotto"</font>
      <ul>
      <li><font color=#006600>"Mauro Picotto - 2002 - Trance 2002"</font></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li><font color=#006600>"DJ Parade"</font>
      <ul>
      <li><font color=#006600>"DJ Parade - 2002 - Compilation"</font></li>
      </ul>
      </li>
  </ul>
</li>
</ul>
You can even click the directories of the tree to see what files will
be put inside it.<p>
If you are satisfied of the results, you can press
the <B>"execute"</B> button. The files will be moved/copied, and for
every file that is processed, a line will be added to the response
window: a green sphere means that everything has gone right for that
file, while a red sphere means that an error has occurred for that
file. A possible reason for a failure could be that the file has invalid characters
(for example "?" or "/" on windows systems).<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>The old directories are not moved nor deleted,
since inside them you could have ".jpg" images of the covers, and you
could later on move them in the correct directory.</B></font>
