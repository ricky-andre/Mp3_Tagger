<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Rename Window</font></h1><p>
The rename window lets you rename files of every type. The actions you can do on file names are described in detail, with some examples to let you better understand how they can be used.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Multi replace</font></h2><p>
This is quite a powerful feature, and it is not so difficult to use it. Suppose that you have a file name called in the following way:<p>

<font color=#006600>"U2 - 03 - Desire - Rattle and Hum - 1987.mp3"</font><p>

You don't like this format, so you want this file to be renamed to:<p>

<font color=#006600>"03 - U2 - Desire.mp3"</font><p>

All you have to do is enter these two strings :<p>
<U>search string:</U> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#006600>"&#60; 1 > - &#60; 2 > - &#60; 3 > - &#60; 4 > - &#60; 5 >.mp3"</font><p>
<U>replace string:</U> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#006600>"&#60; 2 > - &#60; 1 > - &#60; 3 >.mp3"</font><p>

and the trick is done. The search string is applied to the file name, and the elements inside the brackets are found and substituted. In the example above, the same associations are done:<p>

<font color=#006600>"&#60; 1 >"</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; is associated to &nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=#006600>"U2"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"&#60; 2 >"</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; is associated to &nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=#006600>"03"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"&#60; 3 >"</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; is associated to &nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=#006600>"Desire"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"&#60; 4 >"</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; is associated to &nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=#006600>"Rattle and hum"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"&#60; 5 >"</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; is associated to &nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=#006600>"1987"</font><p>

After this first operation, the replace string is parsed and the fields listed above are substituted with the new ones. <p>

<font color=#0000CC><B>Remember to put the brackets with a space
inside them!</B></font> It is not strictly necessary to use numbers,
but probably it is the simplest way to do things. This configurations
would have produced the same results:<p>

<U>search string:</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#006600>"&#60; a > - &#60; b > - &#60; c > - &#60; d > - &#60; e >.mp3"</font><p>
<U>replace string:</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#006600>"&#60; b > - &#60; a > - &#60; c >.mp3"</font><p>

File extensions have to be taken into account, since this window can
be used to rename files of every type, not only mp3 files!
<font color=#0000CC><B>As usual, it is strongly recommended that you use
the "try" button before executing rename operations, to be
sure that the configuration strings you have inserted are correct and
that the result will be what you expect!</B></font><p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>String insertion</font></h2><p>
The string written in the <B>"insert"</B> textfield is inserted into the file name at position written in the <B>"position"</B> textfield. Position "0" means the beginning of the file name. <B>Write the word "end" to insert the string at the end of the file name</B> (this for example could be useful if you have lost your file extension because you made a configuration mistake and you didn't press the "try" button before the "execute" button!). If the position number is higher than the file name length, an error will be given in the warning panel. Spaces are accepted and inserted as normal characters.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>String replace</font></h2><p>
This feature does exactly what it says, it replaces the string written in the <B>"replace"</B> text field with the string written in the <B>"replace with"</B> text field. Spaces and special characters are accepted.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Insert numbers</font></h2><p>
The numbers starting from the specified number are inserted in the
specified position (position "0" is the beginning of the file
name). You can also select if you want to place a leading '0' before
numbers lower than ten (for example "01", "02" and so on). The numbers
are increased one by one and are put in the file names in the
specified position. This feature is quite useful if you like to
insert the songs track numbers inside the file names, or you have
a compilation and you want to insert numbers in the song's file
name. <B>This is why you also have two arrows in the bottom of the
table: you can move up or down the selected files, and then you can
add numbers.</B><p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Case selection</font></h2><p>
This is better explained with some examples. Suppose that you have the following file name:<p>

<font color=#006600>"01 - u2 - beaUTiFul DAY"</font><p>

If you select <B>"Large Case"</B> you will have the following result:<p>

<font color=#006600>"01 - U2 - Beautiful Day"</font><p>

If you select <B>"Lower Case"</B> you will have the following result:<p>

<font color=#006600>"01 - u2 - beautiful day"</font><p>

If you select <B>"Upper Case"</B> you will have the following result:<p>

<font color=#006600>"01 - U2 - BEAUTIFUL DAY"</font><p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Case sensitivity</B></font><p>
This field is applied to the multi-replace "search" string and to the
string that has to be replaced.<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>Suppose that "sensitive" is applied, and that the string to be
replaced is "simple"</B></font>. "Mp3 Studio" will replace every string that is exactly "simple", so it will not replace "Simple", "SIMPLE", "SIMple".  If "non sensitive" is applied, the program will replace also "Simple", "SIMPLE", "SIMple".<p>
Let's take again the example we have done before:<p>

<font color=#006600>"U2 - 03 - Desire - Rattle and Hum - 1987.MP3"</font><p>

In the multireplace panel you write the following strings:<p>

<U>search string:</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#006600>"&#60; 1 > - &#60; 2 > - &#60; 3 > - &#60; 4 > - &#60; 5 >.mp3"</font><p>
<U>replace string:</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#006600>"&#60; 2 > - &#60; 1 > - &#60; 3 >.mp3"</font><p>

<font color=#0000CC><B>If "non sensitive" is selected, everything is all right</B></font>. If "sensitive" is selected, "Mp3 Studio" expects to find exactly ".MP3" at the end of the file name, but in the above example the file name ends with ".mp3", so you will have a "not match found" error in the warning panel.<p>

Just be careful!<p>

You can also rename a single file, by simply selecting a file in the list table, modifying the file name in the text field, and eventually pressing the rename button.<p>

Since configurations in this window can be quite complicated, you can save the configurations by clicking on the <B>"save"</B> button. The configuration will appear in the combo box to be later selected. If you don't need a configuration no more, click on it and push the <B>"delete config"</B> button.<p>
The <B>"remove success"</B> button removes from the table the files you've just successfully renamed. The <B>"try"</B> button will make you see how files will be renamed and the <B>"execute"</B> button executes the rename operation.<p>

Take a look also at the other configuration examples.<p>
