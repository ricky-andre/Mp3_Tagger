The parameters you can insert and the reason for their existence is explained below.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>File extension filter</font></h2>
Since this program is written above all, but not only, to manage mp3
files, the pre-defined extension filter is the string "mp3 ;". You can
add other extensions by simply writing other extensions after the
existing one. The permitted extensions must be separated by a
semi-colon. These are some examples of possible valid extension field values:<p>

<font color=#0000CC><B>".avi ; .txt ;"</B></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(accepts only files ending with ".avi" or ".txt")<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>"avi ; "</B></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(accepts only files ending with "avi")<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "</B></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(accepts every kind of file)<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>" "</B></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(accepts every kind of file)<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>"mp3"</B></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(accepts files ending with "mp3")<p>

You can put all the spaces you want after and before the semi-colon,
it doesn't matter because "Mp3 Studio" does not read them, but probably it becomes easier for you to read the string.
This is a real filter, in the sense that the files that do not have
the listed extensions are not shown in the table and you can't perform
any operation on them.
If you want to accept every file with every possible extension, put in an empty string.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Mp3 files with no mp3 extensions</font></h2>
If you apply this check, when the selected directories are scanned,
"Mp3 Studio" parses also the files with no mp3 extension and checks if
they are mp3 files. This can be useful if some of your friends that
uses Unix or Linux give you a CD that has been created under their
operative system: in this case, some of the files could have names
longer than 64 characters, and when you transfer the CD content on
your hard disk the extensions of some files could be partially ot
totally cut too ... in this way you can discover these files!<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>If you have ".avi" or tar files with some songs inside, be careful
because in that case "Mp3 Studio" will probably tell you that those
files are mp3 files with a wrong extension. This happens because
there are some mp3 files "hidden" inside. In this case you MUST NOT
rename these files and tag them as if they were real mp3 files.</B></font><p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>File length warning</font></h2>
You can insert a minimum value (in bytes) and a maximum value (in bytes). If the file length is lower than the minimum value or higher than the maximum value, "Mp3 Studio" prints a warning in the main window. These values do not effect the files that are shown in the main window table, but only the warnings that are shown in the bottom panel. Moreover, the warnings are shown only for the files that have a correct extension.<p>
The maximum file length value can be useful to identify files that are
too long and that probably contain an hidden track with a lot of
silence before it (Nirvana often did that, but also a lot of other
artists!). You can discover them by using this feature and use some
other program (until "Mp3 Studio" does not provide this feature) to split the file and cut it!<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>File name length warning</font></h2>
You can insert a minimum value (in characters) and a maximum value (in
characters). If the file name length is lower than the minimum value
or higher than the maximum value, "Mp3 Studio" prints a warning in the
main  window. These values do not effect the files that are shown in
the main window table, but only the warnings that are shown in the
bottom panel. Moreover, the warnings are shown only for the files that
have a correct extension.<p>
The maximum file name length can be useful to warn you when files are
longer than 64 characters (pre-defined value): if you crete your CDs
under Windows, you probably know that you can't have file names longer
than 64 characters. This can happen if you have downloaded a file from
from the internet, or also after a rename by tag operation. It is
better  if you know it so that you can modify the file name before you
try to put it on a CD, or the name will be in any case cutted. This
can  also affect the winamp lists you have created, because the
file name is put inside them, so if you modify the file name
after you have created the lists, that song will be skipped by winamp
because it will not find it!<p>
Just be careful ...<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Read-only file warning</font></h2>
If you select this checkbox, you will be warned when a file with a
correct extension is a read-only file, so that you can change the file
properties before trying to rename or tag the file.
