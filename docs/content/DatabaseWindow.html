<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Database Window</font></h1><p>
This is one of the most useful windows, and the reason for which this
program was born. From this window you can view your database, change
its content, perform filtering and reordering operations.<p>
Moreover, a nice "export to html" feature is provided to let you
inspect and browse your database with an internet browser.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Database window options</font></h2>
On the right side of the text field you can browse directories to
select a certain database. You can save the current database pressing
the <B>"save"</B> button. Press the <B>"reload"</B> to load the
database with the selected name. You can easily edit all the database
cells by double-clicking inside a cell. Press enter or click on
another cell to update the content.<p>
If you want to remove some of the database's rows, select all the rows
you want to delete and press the <B>"delete rows"</B> button.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Ordering and Filtering options</font></h2>
You can apply filters to the showed database. For example if you want
to view only your U2 songs, you just have to push the <B>"set
filter options"</B> button, and select the "artist" column, the "contains"
filter and to type "U2" in the text field. You can insert more than
one filter criteria, selecting also if the sentences have to all true,
or if a logical "OR" has to be applied.<p>
Press the <B>"set order options"</B> button to change the database
order. Everything is very easy!<p>

<font color=#0000CC><B>Remember that "Mp3 Studio" applies to the
database the last order and filter criteria. So when you have just
loaded a new database, remember to push the <B>"show all"</B> button
if you want to view all the files contained in the database!
