<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Tag Option Window</font></h1>
In this window you can select the tag type you want to write on files, and the tag type you want to read first in renaming by tag operation.<p>
<h2><font color=#ff6600>Write tag options</font></h2>
You can select one of four possible write-tag modes. When one or more fields have to be written to a file, the following actions are taken (depending on the selected option):<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>only version 1:</B></font> in this case only tag version 1 is written to the file. <U>If tag version 1 does not exists, the tag is created and written.</U><p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>only version 2:</B></font> in this case only tag version 2 is written to the file. <U>If tag version 2 does not exists, the tag is created and written.</U><p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>tag version 1 and version 2:</B></font> in this case tag version 1 and tag version 2 are always  written to the file. <U>If they don't exist, they are created.</U><p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>tag existent:</B></font> if tag version 1 exists, tag version 1 is
written. If tag version 2 exists, tag version 2 is written. If both
tag version 1 and tag version 2 exist, both tags are written. <U>If no
tag exist, only tag version 1 is written.</U><B> (reccomended choice)</B><p>

<font color=#0000CC><B>Avoid information loss when writing tagv1:</B></font> since tag version 1
fields have limited length while tag version 2 fields have not, if you
apply this feature <U>the program automatically writes tag version 2
if you try to set a field longer than what you can do on tag version
1.</U> The other tag version 1 fields are copied too, but only if the
destination tag version 2 field is empty.<B> (reccomended choice)</B><p>
<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>Tag version 2 are written from the start of the mp3 file. If the tag is not present, the first time the tag v2 is written the whole file has to be re-written to create the necessary space. This is a quite slow
operation, and it should be avoided if not strictly necessary. For
this reason, it is highly reccomended that you choose the above
reccomended options.</B></font><p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Read tag options</B></font></h2>
This choice is applied every time "Mp3 Studio" has to read music
tags from files. Since tag version 2 fields can be longer and more
precise than tag version 1, it is reccomended that you select the
first choice (read tag v2 BEFORE tag v1).<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>read tag v2 before tagv1:</B></font> "Mp3 Studio" reads tag version 2 field, <U>if this field is empty it reads tag version 1.</U><p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>read tag v1 before tagv2:</B></font> "Mp3 Studio" reads tag version 1 field, <U>if this field is empty it reads tag version 2.</U><p>
