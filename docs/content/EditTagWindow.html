<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Edit Tag Window</font></h1><p>
The last window of the tagging editor lets you inspect all the file's
mp3 information, and lets you directly edit the tags version 1 and
version 2. <p>
When a file is selected in the bottom panel, its mp3 characteristic
are showed in detail and its tag values are showed too. You can also
rename the file, if you need to.<p>
On the column "Other tag v2 fields" appear the tag version 2 fields
that are of less interest and do not appear in the mass tag
window. When something appear in this column, you can read the values
of the fields by clicking on the file and clicking on the <B>"adv
panel"</B> button.
