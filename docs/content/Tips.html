<h1 align=left><font color=#ff6600>Mp3 Studio Tips</font></h1>
These are some important tips that you are reccomended to read and
follow.

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Tag Options</font></h2>
It is higlhy reccomended that you select the predefined write-tag
parameters. You will avoid information loss (when you will try to write
down a tag field that is longer than what is permitted with tag
version 1), and you will avoid writing tag version 2 when it is not
necessary (and this is a slow operation if the tag has to be written
for the first time). Moreover, with the predefined settings, you will
always have your tags synchronized, in the sense that if tag version 1
and version 2 exist, new fields will be written on both.<p>


<h2><font color=#ff6600>Directory Browser</font></h2>
The directory browser lays on the left side of the main window, and on
the left side of every window contained in the "Utils Window". <p>
Remember to keep pressed "SHIFT" or "CTRL" keys
while clicking with your mouse to select more than one directory at a
time.
<p>You can also rename the directories: click on a node, wait a
moment and do another mouse-click: type in the new name and press "RETURN".
