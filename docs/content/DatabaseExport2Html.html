<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Export to Html</font></h1><p>
This a quite nice feature. You can select a database, load it and
export it to html format. "Mp3 Studio" parses the whole database and
produces an html file every 1000 songs.
Press the <B>"options"</B> button and then press the <B>"export to
html"</B> button. A file chooser will appear: go into the directory in
which you want to put the files and type in the name of the file. The
"html" extension will automatically be applied if it is not inserted
by you.<p>
"Mp3 Studio" will parse the database file and will produce some html
files with 1000 rows each. On the top of the file will appear a list
of letters: you can click on one of them to go to the artist page whose
name start with that letter.<p>
Just try, I think you will find this feature quite nice and in some
way also useful!!
