<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Rename By Tag Window</font></h1><p>
Using this window you can rename files basing on tag values. Everything is very simple: all you have to do is select the fields you want to use to rename files. You can reorder them by pressing the <B>"move up"</B> or <B>"move down"</B> button as usual. The output file name format represents the file name format that will be used to rename files.<p>
If you check the "leading '0' before track number" checkbox, for example track "4" will be written as "04", track "2" will be written as "02" and so on.<p>
You can also edit the output file name format by inserting constant strings that will be written in the file. Suppose that you have an Internet site and you want to put the word "www.yoursite.com" at the end of the file names, and that your favourite file name format is the same of "02 - U2 - Stuck in a moment". To change the file name to this format, select the "track", "artist", "title" fields and edit the output file name format to this string:<p>

"&#60; track > - &#60; artist > - &#60; title > - www.yoursite.com"<p>

The <B>"rename success"</B>, <B>"try"</B> and <B>"execute"</B> button
have the usual behaviour described before. I always recommend you to press the "try" button before pressing "execute", to be sure that the new file names are what you expect to have.
If one of more of the fields selected to rename files are empty, an error message is showed in the warning window.
