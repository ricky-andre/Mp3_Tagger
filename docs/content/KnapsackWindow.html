<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>CD Recording Optimizer Window</font></h1><p>
This window stays on the bottom-half side of the "other" tabbed pane of
the "Utils window".<p>
If you have a lot of directories that have already been tagged and you
want to put them on some CD to free some hard disk space, you can use
this "Mp3 Studio" feature to move the folders in one or more directory
that you can include to create your CD.<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>"Mp3 Studio" finds out what is the best
distribution to fill up the CD(s) space.</B></font><p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>CD recording optimizer options</font></h2>
You can select the <B>"recurse subdirectories"</B> option if you want
to consider also all the subdirectories of the folders selected on the
left side of the window.<p>
Select the number of CD you think that you could fill up by pressing
the . You can easily change the CD capacity by clicking on the combo box inside the
table. You can also click on the <B>"brose dir"</B> button to choose
an existing directory. In this case, the directory is scanned with all
its subdirs and the occupied space is showed, as a percentual number,
in the last column of the table.<p>
On the left panel you can't select directories that are already
contained into the existent directories present in the table: if you
want to do this you have to place them somewhere else.
<font color=#0000CC><B>In  any case "Mp3 Studio" will check all these things
and will warn you if wrong configurations have been set.</B></font>
If you have not selected any existent directory, "Mp3 Studio" will
create the directories for you with the name specified by the <B>"dir
name"</B> column, and will create these new dirs as subdirectories of
the folder you have selected in the bottom of the panel, in the
<B>"create unexistent dirs starting from this directory"</B> combo box.
Again, you can select if you want the files to be <B>moved</B> or to
be <B>copied</B> in the destination directories.<p>

The problem of calculating the way to distribute a certain number of
items, each with a specified weight, in a container of a certain
capacity is known as the "knapsack algorithm". In this case there is a
generalization since the number of the containers can be higher than
one, so that it could be called the "multiple knapsack
algorithm". This explains also the icon, that could be strange to most
of the users!<p>

Press the <B>"try"</B> button to execute the multiple knapsack algorithm.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>CD recording optimizer results</font></h2>
If you press the "try" button, a new window will open as usual, and
all the report information will be listed there.<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>If you press the try button, no file will be
moved nor copied anywhere.</B></font> "Mp3 Studio" will show you where
the selected directories will be put and how much the "knapsacks" will
be filled up. <font color=#0000CC><B>If you selected 8 containers, the
algorithm can be quite slow, but the progress bar shows you how many
containers have been completely filled, and how much unused space
remains. If you are satisifed, press "cancel" and the current solution
will be kept as good.</B></font><p>
If you are satisfied, press the <B>"execute"</B> button to move or
copy the directories. If something goes wrong, "Mp3 Studio" will warn
you about it, and an error message will be printed to the output.
