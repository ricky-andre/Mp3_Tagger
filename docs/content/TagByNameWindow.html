<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Tag By Name Window</font></h1><p>
On the top of the window, you can select the fields you want to write by using the file names. The selected fields are put one after the other on the top-table, but you can change the order of them by selecting the fields on the table and clicking on the <B>"move up"</B> or <B>"move down"</B> buttons: the expected file name format is updated immediately.<p>
You can also modify the <B>"field separator"</B>, even though for most of the files you will use the separator " - ". The expected file name format suggests the way the tag fields are retrieved from the file names, from the left to the right.<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>To avoid mistakes and unwanted behaviours, I always suggest you to press the "try" button to observe the fields that will be set on the selected files</B></font>.<p>
In the warning panel you will observe the result of the tag operation
and the mode operation (try or execute). If some of the files have not
been tagged successfully, these files are listed in the warn panel
and are  signed with a red sphere. The problem can be one of the following ones:

<ul>
<li> the file is read-only, and it cannot be tagged</li>
<li> the file has a name format that does not match the selected one</li>
<li> the field you are trying to set is not correct (for example if you are trying to set the track field, it obviously must be a number)</li>
</ul>

When you have tagged a lot of files, probably you will want to finish your work with those files that have a different format from the one you have selected and used for the last tag operation, the files signed with a red sphere in the warning panel: press the <B>"remove success"</B> button to remove from the table all the files that have been successfully tagged performing the last "execute" operation.<p>
The <B>"add trash"</B> button function is explained in configuration examples.<p>

<font color=#0000CC><B>You have to understand carefully how "Mp3 Studio" works to avoid
unwanted behaviours, so it is highly reccomended that you carefully
give a look to the configuration examples.</B></font>
