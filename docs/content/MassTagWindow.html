<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Mass Tag Window</font></h1><p>
This is one of the most powerful and rich windows of "Tag Studio". In the <B>"operation and options selection"</B> you can select the operation you want to perform on the selected files. The selectable operations are described in the following paragraph.<p>

<ul>
<li><font color=#0000CC><B>Mass tag:</B></font> you can select the same fields on all the selected files. Choose the fields you want to select by simply clicking on the "yes/no" icons on the right side of the window.</li>
<li><font color=#0000CC><B>clear tag v1 (some fields):</B></font> does what it says. Press on the "yes/no" icons to set the fields you want to clear. The "track" field and a lot of other fields are selectable from the combo box contained in the "other field" row.</li>
<li><font color=#0000CC><B>clear tag v1 (all fields):</B></font> simply does what it says.</li>
<li><font color=#0000CC><B>clear tag v2 (some fields):</B></font> does what it says. Press on the "yes/no" icons to set the fields you want to clear. The "track" field and a lot of other fields are selectable from the combo box contained in the "other field" row.</li>
<li><font color=#0000CC><B>clear tag v2 (all fields):</B></font> simply does what it says.</li>
<li><font color=#0000CC><B>clear tags v1-v2 (some fields):</B></font> clears the selected fields on both tags.</li>
<li><font color=#0000CC><B>clear tags v1-v2 (all fields):</B></font> simply does what it says.</li>
<li><font color=#0000CC><B>copy tag v1 to tag v2 (some fields):</B></font> copies the selected fields from tag version 1 to tag version 2. You can select if you want to copy the tag v1 fields only if they are not empty and/or only if the destination field is not empty.</li>
<li><font color=#0000CC><B>copy tag v1 to tag v2 (all fields):</B></font> simply does what it says. You can select if you want to copy the tag v1 fields only if they are not empty and/or only if the destination field is not empty.</li>
<li><font color=#0000CC><B>copy tag v2 to tag v1 (all fields):</B></font> simply does what it says.</li>
<li><font color=#0000CC><B>remove tag v1:</B></font> simply does what it says.</li>
<li><font color=#0000CC><B>remove tag v2:</B></font> simply does what it says.</li>
</ul>

On the <B>"other field"</B> panel, you can select fields of less interest, such as the "track" or "title" field, and you can select the <B>"advanced panel"</B>. Selecting this field will make appear a button on the right: click this button to make the "advanced mass tag window" appear.<p>
Remember that in "Mp3 Studio", <B>"empty field" is equal to "field
that contains only spaces"</B>. The <B>"remove success"</B>,
<B>"try"</B> and <B>"execute"</B> buttons have the same behaviour that has been described in the previous section, describing the "tag by name" window.
