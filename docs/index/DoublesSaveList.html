This window gives the way to find out if you have duplicated songs
inside your database. You can search inside a database file created
with "Mp3 Studio" or inside the directories you have selected in some way.<p>

The list of the possible duplicated songs can be written to disk if
you select the "save list" checkbox. Press the "browse" button to
select an existing file or directory and complete writing the file name.
