<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Organizer Window</font></h1><p>
This window lets you reorganize your mp3 files in directories and
subdirectories with names that are based on the tag values.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Organizer fields selection</font></h2><p>
On the top of the window, you can select the fields you want to use
to create the directories. The selected fields are put one after the
other on the table, but you can change the order of them by
selecting the fields and clicking on the <B>"move up"</B>
or <B>"move down"</B> buttons: the expected directory name format is
updated immediately.<p>
To remove one or more fields, select them and press the <B>"delete field"</B>
button.<p>
When you have decided and composed the full directory name, you can
add it to the directory-table by pressing the <B>"add string"</B> button.
