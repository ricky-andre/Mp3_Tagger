<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Database Creator Window</font></h1><p>
Using this window you can create and keep updated a beautiful database
with all your mp3 songs and all the information you want. You can
order your existing database by artist, by album, by title, by file
name or by a combination of them.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Field separator</font></h2><p>
The <B>"field separator"</B> separates the selected fields between
them. It is quite an important string, and it should be a string that
is never contained inside the fields values. You should choose an
uncommon character such as ";" or "%". <font color=#0000CC><B>I strongly recommend you to
choose the tab character ("\t") that is the predefined value</B></font>. It
will be very easy to load up the database list with other programs
such as "Excel" or "Star Office" if you make this choice.<p>
