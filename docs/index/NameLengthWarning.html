<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Options Window</font></h1>
In the "options window" you can select the read/write tag options, the
file filters and the file the file warnings.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>File name length warning</font></h2>
You can insert a minimum value (in characters) and a maximum value (in
characters). If the file name length is lower than the minimum value
or higher than the maximum value, "Mp3 Studio" prints a warning in the
main  window. These values do not effect the files that are shown in
the main window table, but only the warnings that are shown in the
bottom panel. Moreover, the warnings are shown only for the files that
have a correct extension.<p>
The maximum file name length can be useful to warn you when files are
longer than 64 characters (pre-defined value): if you crete your CDs
under Windows, you probably know that you can't have file names longer
than 64 characters. This can happen if you have downloaded a file from
from the internet, or also after a rename by tag operation. It is
better  if you know it so that you can modify the file name before you
try to put it on a CD, or the name will be in any case cutted. This
can  also affect the winamp lists you have created, because the
file name is put inside them, so if you modify the file name
after you have created the lists, that song will be skipped by winamp
because it will not find it!<p>
Just be careful ...<p>
