<h2><font color=#ff6600>File extension filter</font></h2>
Since this program is written above all, but not only, to manage mp3
files, the pre-defined extension filter is the string "mp3 ;". You can
add other extensions by simply writing other extensions after the
existing one. The permitted extensions must be separated by a
semi-colon. These are some examples of possible valid extension field values:<p>

<font color=#0000CC><B>".avi ; .txt ;"</B></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(accepts only files ending with ".avi" or ".txt")<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>"avi ; "</B></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(accepts only files ending with "avi")<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   "</B></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(accepts every kind of file)<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>" "</B></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(accepts every kind of file)<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>"mp3"</B></font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(accepts files ending with "mp3")<p>

You can put all the spaces you want after and before the semi-colon,
it doesn't matter because "Mp3 Studio" does not read them, but probably it becomes easier for you to read the string.
This is a real filter, in the sense that the files that do not have
the listed extensions are not shown in the table and you can't perform
any operation on them.
If you want to accept every file with every possible extension, put in an empty string.<p>
