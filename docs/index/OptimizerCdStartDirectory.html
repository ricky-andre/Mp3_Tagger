<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Optimizer Window</font></h1><p>
This window is useful to help you in moving some directories to
prepare them to be put in a CD. "Mp3 Studio" automatically finds out
the best way to move the directories so that all the available space
is used.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Optimizer start directory</font></h2><p>
In the container table you can select some directories that already
exist, or you can choose a name for a directory that has to be
created, for example you could write in the name "CD 4".<p>
The directory "CD 4" will be created inside the directory that is
selected in this text field. If this text field contains for example "d:\", the
directory "d:\cd 4" will be created before filling it up with some of
the selected directories.
