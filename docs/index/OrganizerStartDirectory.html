<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Organizer Window</font></h1><p>
This window lets you reorganize your mp3 files in directories and
subdirectories with names that are based on the tag values.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Start Directory</font></h2><p>
This directory represents the start point from which the files are
reorganized and will be moved or copied to. Remember that the move
option will be very fast only if the source and destination file stay
on the same hard disk partition (for example "C:\").
