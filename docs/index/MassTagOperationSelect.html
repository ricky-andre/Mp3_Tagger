When a clear operation is selected, the text fields will become not
writable, since only the yes/no icons have to be selected to perform
operations. If the "remove" operation is selected, also the icons will
disappear, since the tag remotion does not depend from the yes/no
icons buttons press. 
If the "copy" operation is selected, the copy-options cehckbox will
become active and selectable.
