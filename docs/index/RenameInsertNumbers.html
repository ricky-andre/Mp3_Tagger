<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Rename Window</font></h1><p>
This window gives you a powerful tool to rename files of every extension.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Insert numbers</font></h2><p>
The numbers starting from the specified number are inserted in the
specified position (position "0" is the beginning of the file
name). You can also select if you want to place a leading '0' before
numbers lower than ten (for example "01", "02" and so on). The numbers
are increased one by one and are put in the file names in the
specified position. This feature is quite useful if you like to
insert the songs track numbers inside the file names, or you have
a compilation and you want to insert numbers in the song's file
name. <B>This is why you also have two arrows in the bottom of the
table: you can move up or down the selected files, and then you can
add numbers.</B><p>
