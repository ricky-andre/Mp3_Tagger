<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Directory Tree Panel</font></h1>
On the top of the panel there's a combo box in which you can insert
the directories where you usually place your files. If you have more
than one partition on your hard disk, you will probably find useful to
insert them here to quickly jump from one directory to another one. Simply click on the <B>"add" button</B> to insert the current directory in the combo box.<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>Remember to keep pressed "SHIFT" or "CTRL" keys
while clicking with your mouse to select more than one directory at a
time. You can also rename the directories: clicking on a node, wait a
moment and do another mouse-click: type the new name and press "RETURN"</B></font><p>
