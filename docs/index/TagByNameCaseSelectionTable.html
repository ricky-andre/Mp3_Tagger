<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Tag by Name Window</font></h1>
The "tag by name window" is used to write tags on selected files using
the file name value. You can perform case conversions, and edit the
"expected file name format" to face particular cases.<p>
Read the "configuration examples" in the content window to fully
understand how this window can be used in all its features.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Case selection table</font></h2><p>
The case selection table is placed on the top-right side of the tag by
name window.<p>
On the first column there are the fields on which you can apply a case
conversion. On the second column you can select the case conversion
that has to be applied to the selected field.<p>
The effects of a case conversion can be better explained with some
examples. Suppose that you have the following file name:<p>

<font color=#006600>"beaUTiFul DAY"</font><p>

If you select <B>"Large Case"</B> you will have the following result:<p>

<font color=#006600>"Beautiful Day"</font><p>

If you select <B>"Lower Case"</B> you will have the following result:<p>

<font color=#006600>"beautiful day"</font><p>

If you select <B>"Upper Case"</B> you will have the following result:<p>

<font color=#006600>"BEAUTIFUL DAY"</font><p>

If you select <B>"First Capitalized"</B> you will have the following result:<p>

<font color=#006600>"BeaUTiFul DAY"</font><p>

If you select nothing, no letter is touched and the word is left as is:<p>

<font color=#006600>"beaUTiFul DAY"</font><p>
