<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Rename Window</font></h1><p>
This window gives you a powerful tool to rename files of every extension.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Case sensitivity</B></font><p>
This field is applied to the multi-replace "search" string and to the
string that has to be replaced.<p>
<font color=#0000CC><B>Suppose that "sensitive" is applied, and that
the string to be replaced is "simple"</B></font>. "Mp3 Studio" will replace every string that is exactly "simple", so it will not replace "Simple", "SIMPLE", "SIMple".  If "non sensitive" is applied, the program will replace also "Simple", "SIMPLE", "SIMple".<p>
Let's take again the example we have done before:<p>

<font color=#006600>"U2 - 03 - Desire - Rattle and Hum - 1987.MP3"</font><p>

In the multireplace panel you write the following strings:<p>

<U>search string:</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#006600>"&#60; 1 > - &#60; 2 > - &#60; 3 > - &#60; 4 > - &#60; 5 >.mp3"</font><p>
<U>replace string:</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#006600>"&#60; 2 > - &#60; 1 > - &#60; 3 >.mp3"</font><p>

<font color=#0000CC><B>If "non sensitive" is selected, everything is all right</B></font>. If "sensitive" is selected, "Mp3 Studio" expects to find exactly ".MP3" at the end of the file name, but in the above example the file name ends with ".mp3", so you will have a "not match found" error in the warning panel.<p>

Just be careful!<p>
