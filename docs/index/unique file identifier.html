<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Tag v2</font></h1><p>
This is one of the frames introduced by tag version 2 standard.<p>
Tag version 2 technical specifications can be found at "www.id3.org".<p>Not all the frames defined by this standard are yet supported by
"Mp3 studio", but most of them are described here for completeness reasons.
You can set the supported frames using the "Advanced
mass tag window" or the "Advanced edit tag window". <p><h2><font color=#ff6600 align=center>Unique file identifier</font></h2><p>
This frame's purpose is to be able to identify the audio file in a database that may contain more information relevant to the content. Since standardisation of such a database is beyond this document, all frames begin with a null-terminated string with a URL containing an email address, or a link to a location where an email address can be found, that belongs to the organisation responsible for this specific database implementation. Questions regarding the database should be sent to the indicated email address. The URL should not be used for the actual database queries. The string "http://www.id3.org/dummy/ufid.html" should be used for tests. Software that isn't told otherwise may safely remove such frames. The 'Owner identifier' must be non-empty (more than just a termination). The 'Owner identifier' is then followed by the actual identifier, which may be up to 64 bytes. There may be more than one "UFID" frame in a tag, but only one with the same 'Owner identifier'.
