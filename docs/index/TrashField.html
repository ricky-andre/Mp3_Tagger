<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Trash Field</font></h1>
The "trash field" is present in the "tag by name" window and in the
"advanced tag search" window. This field is useful to identify a field
that has no interest for the current operation, and that has to be
skipped for this reason.<p>
Carefully give a look to the configuration examples of the "tag by
name" window in the "content help" to understand how this field can be used.
