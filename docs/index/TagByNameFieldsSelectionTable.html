<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Tag by Name Window</font></h1>
The "tag by name window" is used to write tags on selected files using
the file name value. You can perform case conversions, and edit the
"expected file name format" to face particular cases.<p>
Read the "configuration examples" in the content window to fully
understand how this window can be used in all its features.<p>

<h2 align=left><font color=#ff6600>Fields Selection</font></h2>
On the top of the window, you can select the fields you want to write
by using the file names. The selected fields are put one after the
other on the table, but you can change the order of them by
selecting the fields and clicking on the <B>"move up"</B>
or <B>"move down"</B> buttons: the expected file name format is
updated immediately.<p>
To remove one or more fields, select them and press the <B>"delete field"</B>
button.<p>
If you don't want to use a certain field of the file name, press the
<B>"add trash"</B> button to add a trash field. The trash field is a
field that will not be written to the files.
