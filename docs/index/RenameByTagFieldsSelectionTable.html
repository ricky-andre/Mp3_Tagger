<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Rename By Tag Window</font></h1>
The "rename by tag window" is used to rename files using their tag values.<p>

<h2 align=left><font color=#ff6600>Fields Selection Table</font></h2>
On the top of the window, you can select the fields you want to use
to rename files. The selected fields are put one after the
other on the table, but you can change the order of them by
selecting the fields and clicking on the <B>"move up"</B>
or <B>"move down"</B> buttons: the output file name format is
updated immediately.<p>
To remove one or more fields, select them and press the <B>"delete field"</B>
button.<p>
You can also type-in the field name to insert a constant string.
