<H3>4.7.MPEG location lookup table</H3>
<P class=t>To increase performance and accuracy of jumps within a <A

timecodes in different locations in the file might be useful. The ID3v2 frame 
includes references that the software can use to calculate positions in the 
file. After the frame header is a descriptor of how much the 'frame counter' 
should increase for every reference. If this value is two then the first 
reference points out the second frame, the 2nd reference the 4th frame, the 3rd 
reference the 6th frame etc. In a similar way the 'bytes between reference' and 
'milliseconds between reference' points out bytes and milliseconds respectively. 
</P>
<P class=t>Each reference consists of two parts; a certain number of bits, as 
defined in 'bits for bytes deviation', that describes the difference between 
what is said in 'bytes between reference' and the reality and a certain number 
of bits, as defined in 'bits for milliseconds deviation', that describes the 
difference between what is said in 'milliseconds between reference' and the 
reality. The number of bits in every reference, i.e. 'bits for bytes 
deviation'+'bits for milliseconds deviation', must be a multiple of four. There 
may only be one "MLLT" frame in each tag. </P>

<P class=t>For a more accurate description of the tempo of a musical piece this 
frame might be used. After the header follows one byte describing which time 
stamp format should be used. Then follows one or more tempo codes. Each tempo 
code consists of one tempo part and one time part. The tempo is in BPM described 
with one or two bytes. If the first byte has the value $FF, one more byte 
follows, which is added to the first giving a range from 2 - 510 BPM, since $00 
and $01 is reserved. $00 is used to describe a beat-free time period, which is 
not the same as a music-free time period. $01 is used to indicate one single 
beat-stroke followed by a beat-free period. </P>
<P class=t>The tempo descriptor is followed by a time stamp. Every time the 
tempo in the music changes, a tempo descriptor may indicate this for the player.

whatever size of text is considered to be convenient by the encoder) is a null 
terminated string followed by a time stamp denoting where in the sound file it 
belongs. Each sync thus has the following structure: </P>
<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE border=0 width="70%">

  <TR>
    <TD>Time stamp</TD>
    <TD>$xx (xx ...)</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER>
<P class=t>The 'time stamp' is set to zero or the whole sync is omitted if 
located directly at the beginning of the sound. All time stamps should be sorted 
in chronological order. The sync can be considered as a validator of the 
subsequent string. </P>
<P class=t>Newline ($0A) characters are allowed in all "SYLT" frames and should 
be used after every entry (name, event etc.) in a frame with the content type 
$03 - $04. </P>
<P class=t>A few considerations regarding whitespace characters: Whitespace 
separating words should mark the beginning of a new word, thus occurring in 
front of the first syllable of a new word. This is also valid for new line 
characters. A syllable followed by a comma should not be broken apart with a 
sync (both the syllable and the comma should be before the sync).</P>
<P class=t>An example: The "USLT" passage</P>
<P class=ind>"Strangers in the night" $0A "Exchanging glances"</P>
<P class=t>would be "SYLT" encoded as:</P>

<P class=t>This is a more subjective function than the previous ones. It allows 
the user to say how much he wants to increase/decrease the volume on each 
channel while the file is played. The purpose is to be able to align all files 
to a reference volume, so that you don't have to change the volume constantly. 
This frame may also be used to balance adjust the audio. If the volume peak 
levels are known then this could be described with the 'Peak volume right' and 
'Peak volume left' field. If Peakvolume is not known these fields could be left 
zeroed or, if no other data follows, be completely omitted. There may only be

<H3>4.14.Reverb</H3>
<P class=t>Yet another subjective one. You may here adjust echoes of different 
kinds. Reverb left/right is the delay between every bounce in ms. Reverb bounces 
left/right is the number of bounces that should be made. $FF equals an infinite 
number of bounces. Feedback is the amount of volume that should be returned to 
the next echo bounce. $00 is 0%, $FF is 100%. If this value were $7F, there 
would be 50% volume reduction on the first bounce, 50% of that on the second and 
so on. Left to left means the sound from the left bounce to be played in the 
left speaker, while left to right means sound from the left bounce to be played 
in the right speaker. </P>
<P class=t>'Premix left to right' is the amount of left sound to be mixed in the

$FF would result in a mono output (if the reverb is applied symmetric). There

<H3>4.19.Recommended buffer size</H3>
<P class=t>Sometimes the server from which a audio file is streamed is aware of 
transmission or coding problems resulting in interruptions in the audio stream. 
In these cases, the size of the buffer can be recommended by the server using 
this frame. If the 'embedded info flag' is true (1) then this indicates that an 
ID3 tag with the maximum size described in 'Buffer size' may occur in the 
audiostream. In such case the tag should reside between two <A 
href="http://www.id3.org/id3v2.3.0.html#MPEG">MPEG</A> frames, if the audio is 
<A href="http://www.id3.org/id3v2.3.0.html#MPEG">MPEG</A> encoded. If the 
position of the next tag is known, 'offset to next tag' may be used. The offset 
is calculated from the end of tag in which this frame resides to the first byte 
of the header in the next. This field may be omitted. Embedded tags are 
generally not recommended since this could render unpredictable behaviour from 
present software/hardware. </P>
<P class=t>For applications like streaming audio it might be an idea to embed 
tags into the audio stream though. If the clients connects to individual 
connections like HTTP and there is a possibility to begin every transmission 
with a tag, then this tag should include a 'recommended buffer size' frame. If 
the client is connected to a arbitrary point in the stream, such as radio or 
multicast, then the 'recommended buffer size' frame should be included in every 
tag. Every tag that is picked up after the initial/first tag is to be considered 
as an update of the previous one. E.g. if there is a "<A 
href="http://www.id3.org/id3v2.3.0.html#TIT2">TIT2</A>" frame in the first 
received tag and one in the second tag, then the first should be 'replaced' with 
the second. </P>
<P class=t>The 'Buffer size' should be kept to a minimum. There may only be one 
"RBUF" frame in each tag. </P>

whom. Since standardisation of such encrypion scheme is beyond this document, 
all "AENC" frames begin with a terminated string with a URL containing an email 
address, or a link to a location where an email address can be found, that 
belongs to the organisation responsible for this specific encrypted audio file. 
Questions regarding the encrypted audio should be sent to the email address 
specified. If a $00 is found directly after the 'Frame size' and the audiofile 
indeed is encrypted, the whole file may be considered useless. </P>
<P class=t>After the 'Owner identifier', a pointer to an unencrypted part of the 
audio can be specified. The 'Preview start' and 'Preview length' is described in 
frames. If no part is unencrypted, these fields should be left zeroed. After the 
'preview length' field follows optionally a datablock required for decryption of 
the audio. There may be more than one "AENC" frames in a tag, but only one with

same contents. A linked frame is to be considered as part of the tag and has the 
same restrictions as if it was a physical part of the tag (i.e. only one "RVRB"

<H3>4.25.Commercial frame</H3>
<P class=t>This frame enables several competing offers in the same tag by 
bundling all needed information. That makes this frame rather complex but it's 
an easier solution than if one tries to achieve the same result with several 
frames. The frame begins, after the frame ID, size and encoding fields, with a 
price string field. A price is constructed by one three character currency code, 
encoded according to <A 
href="http://www.id3.org/id3v2.3.0.html#ISO-4217">ISO-4217</A> alphabetic 
currency code, followed by a numerical value where "." is used as decimal 
seperator. In the price string several prices may be concatenated, seperated by 
a "/" character, but there may only be one currency of each type. </P>
<P class=t>The price string is followed by an 8 character date string in the 
format YYYYMMDD, describing for how long the price is valid. After that is a 
contact <A href="http://www.id3.org/id3v2.3.0.html#URL">URL</A>, with which the 
user can contact the seller, followed by a one byte 'received as' field. It 
describes how the audio is delivered when bought according to the following

The 'Owner identifier' is a null-terminated string with a <A

<H3>5.The 'unsynchronisation scheme'</H3>
<P class=t>The only purpose of the 'unsynchronisation scheme' is to make the 
ID3v2 tag as compatible as possible with existing software. There is no use in 
'unsynchronising' tags if the file is only to be processed by new software. 
Unsynchronisation may only be made with MPEG 2 layer I, II and III and MPEG 2.5 
files. </P>
<P class=t>Whenever a false synchronisation is found within the tag, one zeroed 
byte is inserted after the first false synchronisation byte. The format of a 
correct sync that should be altered by ID3 encoders is as follows: </P>
<P class=ind>%11111111 111xxxxx </P>
<P class=t>And should be replaced with: </P>
<P class=ind>%11111111 00000000 111xxxxx </P>
<P class=t>This has the side effect that all $FF 00 combinations have to be 
altered, so they won't be affected by the decoding process. Therefore all the 
$FF 00 combinations have to be replaced with the $FF 00 00 combination during 
the unsynchronisation. </P>
<P class=t>To indicate usage of the unsynchronisation, the first bit in 'ID3 
flags' should be set. This bit should only be set if the tag contains a, now 
corrected, false synchronisation. The bit should only be clear if the tag does 
not contain any false synchronisations. </P>
<P class=t>Do bear in mind, that if a compression scheme is used by the encoder, 
the unsynchronisation scheme should be applied *afterwards*. When decoding a 
compressed, 'unsynchronised' file, the 'unsynchronisation scheme' should be 
parsed first, decompression afterwards. </P>
<P class=t>If the last byte in the tag is $FF, and there is a need to eliminate 
false synchronisations in the tag, at least one byte of padding should be added.
