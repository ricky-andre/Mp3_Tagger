<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Database Creator Window</font></h1><p>
Using this window you can create and keep updated a beautiful database
with all your mp3 songs and all the information you want. You can
order your existing database by artist, by album, by title, by file
name or by a combination of them.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Order output list options</font></h2><p>
Let's now examine the <B>"order output list options"</B>. You can
select if you want to order the output database list, and you can
choose between 4 ordering criteria: by artist, by album, by title, by
year or by file name. Simply select what you want in the combo boxes and
select them from left to right with the same order with which the
ordering actions have to be taken. Remember that in any case you can
perform ordering operations on the database also in the "Database window".<p>
