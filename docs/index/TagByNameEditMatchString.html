<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Tag by Name Window</font></h1>
The "tag by name window" is used to write tags on selected files using
the file name value. You can perform case conversions, and edit the
"expected file name format" to face particular cases.<p>
Read the "configuration examples" in the content window to fully
understand how this window can be used in all its features.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Match String</font></h2><p>
The "match string" represents the string that is used with the file
names to retrieve the tag values that have to be written.<p>
For example if the field name is the following one:<p>

<U>File name:</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#006600>"01 - Kate Bush - Running up that hill.mp3"</font><p>

... the expected file name format must be the following string:<p>

<U>Expected format:</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#006600>"&#60; track > - &#60; artist > - &#60; title >"</font><p>

You can do it by hand or you can select the correct fields, putting
them in the correct order, and selecting the field separator " - ".
Sometimes it not possible to do it without editing the match
string. For example in this case:

<U>File name:</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#006600>"01.Running up that hill.mp3"</font><p>

.. you should select the correct fields and then select the field
separator "." or " - ". Then edit the match string until it is the
following one:<p>

<U>Expected format:</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#006600>"&#60; track >.&#60; title>"</font><p>
