This is one of the frames introduced by tag version 2 standard.<p>
Tag version 2 technical specifications can be found at "www.id3.org".<p>Not all the frames defined by this standard are yet supported by
"Mp3 studio", but most of them are described here for completeness reasons.

The 'Copyright message' frame, which must begin with a year and a space character (making five characters), is intended for the copyright holder of the original sound, not the audio file itself. The absence of this frame means only that the copyright information is unavailable or has been removed, and must not be interpreted to mean that the sound is public domain. Every time this field is displayed the field must be preceded with "Copyright © ".
