<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Organizer Window</font></h1><p>
This window lets you reorganize your mp3 files in directories and
subdirectories with names that are based on the tag values.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Case selection table</font></h2><p>
The case selection table is placed on the center-right side of the tag by
name window.<p>
On the first column there are the fields on which you can apply a case
conversion. On the second column you can select the case conversion
that has to be applied to the selected field.<p>
The case conversion is applied to all the tags that are read on the
selected fields, so that you can create your directories with the case
format you like best.
The effects of a case conversion can be better explained with some
examples. Suppose that you have the following file name:<p>

<font color=#006600>"beaUTiFul DAY"</font><p>

If you select <B>"Large Case"</B> you will have the following result:<p>

<font color=#006600>"Beautiful Day"</font><p>

If you select <B>"Lower Case"</B> you will have the following result:<p>

<font color=#006600>"beautiful day"</font><p>

If you select <B>"Upper Case"</B> you will have the following result:<p>

<font color=#006600>"BEAUTIFUL DAY"</font><p>

If you select <B>"First Capitalized"</B> you will have the following result:<p>

<font color=#006600>"BeaUTiFul DAY"</font><p>

If you select nothing, no letter is touched and the word is left as is:<p>

<font color=#006600>"beaUTiFul DAY"</font><p>
