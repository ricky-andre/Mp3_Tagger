<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Database Creator Window</font></h1><p>
Using this window you can create and keep updated a beautiful database
with all your mp3 songs and all the information you want. You can
order your existing database by artist, by album, by title, by file
name or by a combination of them.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Fields selection</font></h2><p>
On the top of the panel, you can select what fields have to be put in
your database list. The fields are placed one after the other, in the
same order they are listed in the table, and with the <B>field
separator</B> character placed between them. You can change the order
by selecting the fields on the table and pressing the <B>"move up"</B>
or <B>"move down"</B> arrows.<p>
You can even add an editable <B>"user field</B>" value: just double
click on it to change the pre-defined value. It is very useful to
store the CD identifier, and this is the reason for which this field
was introduced, but you can use it to write what you want. The only
limitation is that the "user field" cannot contain the separator
character, nor any other field-word ("artist", "title", "song length"
and so on ...), since this could give problems to the database updates
and expansions. When I will later explain how the database is created
and updated you will understand the reason for that. In any case don't
worry about that because "Mp3 Studio" will warn you if you make any
configuration mistake.<p>
