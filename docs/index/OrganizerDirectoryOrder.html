<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Organizer Window</font></h1><p>
This window lets you reorganize your mp3 files in directories and
subdirectories with names that are based on the tag values.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Organizer directory order</font></h2><p>
This table represents the order of the directories that will be
created. For example if the first row is "genre", all the files with
the same "genre" field will be put in the same directory. If there is
a second row, and this row is "artist", all the files with the same
"artist" field will be put in this directory, that will be created if
it does not already exist.
Look in the content help window for a useful example and to understand
exactly how this window works.
