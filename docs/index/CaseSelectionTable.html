<h1><font color=#ff6600>Case selection table</font></h1><p>
The case selection table is present in the "tag by name" window, in
the "rename by tag" window, and in the "organizer" window.<p>
On the first column there are the fields on which you can apply a case
conversion. On the second column you can select the case conversion
that has to be applied to the selected field.<p>
The effects of a case conversion can be better explained with some
examples. Suppose that you have the following file name:<p>

<font color=#006600>"beaUTiFul DAY"</font><p>

If you select <B>"Large Case"</B> you will have the following result:<p>

<font color=#006600>"Beautiful Day"</font><p>

If you select <B>"Lower Case"</B> you will have the following result:<p>

<font color=#006600>"beautiful day"</font><p>

If you select <B>"Upper Case"</B> you will have the following result:<p>

<font color=#006600>"BEAUTIFUL DAY"</font><p>

If you select <B>"First Capitalized"</B> you will have the following result:<p>

<font color=#006600>"BeaUTiFul DAY"</font><p>

If you select nothing, no letter is touched and the word is left as is:<p>

<font color=#006600>"beaUTiFul DAY"</font><p>
