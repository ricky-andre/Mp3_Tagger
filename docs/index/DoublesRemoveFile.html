This window gives the way to find out if you have duplicated songs
inside your database. You can search inside a database file created
with "Mp3 Studio" or inside the directories you have selected in some way.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Remove file</font></h2><p>
If you have added the wrong database, select the database you want to
remove in the table and press the remove file button.
If you don't want to scan any directory, deselect everything from the
directory panel.
