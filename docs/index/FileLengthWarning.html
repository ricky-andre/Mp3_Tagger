<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Options Window</font></h1>
In the "options window" you can select the read/write tag options, the
file filters and the file the file warnings.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>File length warning</font></h2>
You can insert a minimum value (in bytes) and a maximum value (in bytes). If the file length is lower than the minimum value or higher than the maximum value, "Mp3 Studio" prints a warning in the main window. These values do not effect the files that are shown in the main window table, but only the warnings that are shown in the bottom panel. Moreover, the warnings are shown only for the files that have a correct extension.<p>
The maximum file length value can be useful to identify files that are
too long and that probably contain an hidden track with a lot of
silence before it (Nirvana often did that, but also a lot of other
artists!). You can discover them by using this feature and use some
other program (until "Mp3 Studio" does not provide this feature) to split the file and cut it!<p>
