<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Rename By Tag Window</font></h1>
The "rename by tag window" is used to rename files using their tag values.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Case selection table</font></h2><p>
On the first column there are the fields on which you can apply a case
conversion. On the second column you can select the case conversion
that has to be applied to the selected field.<p>
The effects of a case conversion can be better explained with some
examples. Suppose that you have the following file name:<p>

<font color=#006600>"beaUTiFul DAY"</font><p>

If you select <B>"Large Case"</B> you will have the following result:<p>

<font color=#006600>"Beautiful Day"</font><p>

If you select <B>"Lower Case"</B> you will have the following result:<p>

<font color=#006600>"beautiful day"</font><p>

If you select <B>"Upper Case"</B> you will have the following result:<p>

<font color=#006600>"BEAUTIFUL DAY"</font><p>

If you select <B>"First Capitalized"</B> you will have the following result:<p>

<font color=#006600>"BeaUTiFul DAY"</font><p>

If you select nothing, no letter is touched and the word is left as is:<p>

<font color=#006600>"beaUTiFul DAY"</font><p>

The tag values are converted into the selected vase before renaming files.
