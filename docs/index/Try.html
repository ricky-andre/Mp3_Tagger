<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Try Button</font></h1>
This button is present in almost all the windows of "Mp3
Studio". Pressing this button no real operation will be performed,
only the effects of an execute operation will be showed to you. In
this way you can always check if you are going to do a correct
operation before doing it.
