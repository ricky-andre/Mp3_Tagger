<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Doubles Window</font></h1><p>
This window gives the way to find out if you have duplicated songs
inside your database. You can search inside a database file created
with "Mp3 Studio" or inside the directories you have selected in some way.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Search inside</font></h2><p>
If you select this checkbox, "Mp3 Studio" will search also inside the
same database to find out possible duplicated songs.
