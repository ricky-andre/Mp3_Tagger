<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Database Creator Window</font></h1><p>
Using this window you can create and keep updated a beautiful database
with all your mp3 songs and all the information you want. You can
order your existing database by artist, by album, by title, by file
name or by a combination of them.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>User field</font></h2><p>
This is a field you can add and that you can edit to write what you
want. This field will be written in all the rows that will be added to
the database.<p>
You will probably use it to store the CD number where you will put the
scanned songs.
