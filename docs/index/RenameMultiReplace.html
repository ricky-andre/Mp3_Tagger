<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Rename Window</font></h1><p>
This window gives you a powerful tool to rename files of every extension.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Multi replace</font></h2><p>
This is quite a powerful feature, and it is not so difficult to use it. Suppose that you have a file name called in the following way:<p>

<font color=#006600>"U2 - 03 - Desire - Rattle and Hum - 1987.mp3"</font><p>

You don't like this format, so you want this file to be renamed to:<p>

<font color=#006600>"03 - U2 - Desire.mp3"</font><p>

All you have to do is enter these two strings :<p>
<U>search string:</U> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#006600>"&#60; 1 > - &#60; 2 > - &#60; 3 > - &#60; 4 > - &#60; 5 >.mp3"</font><p>
<U>replace string:</U> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#006600>"&#60; 2 > - &#60; 1 > - &#60; 3 >.mp3"</font><p>

and the trick is done. The search string is applied to the file name, and the elements inside the brackets are found and substituted. In the example above, the same associations are done:<p>

<font color=#006600>"&#60; 1 >"</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; is associated to &nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=#006600>"U2"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"&#60; 2 >"</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; is associated to &nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=#006600>"03"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"&#60; 3 >"</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; is associated to &nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=#006600>"Desire"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"&#60; 4 >"</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; is associated to &nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=#006600>"Rattle and hum"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"&#60; 5 >"</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; is associated to &nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=#006600>"1987"</font><p>

After this first operation, the replace string is parsed and the fields listed above are substituted with the new ones. <p>

<font color=#0000CC><B>Remember to put the brackets with a space
inside them!</B></font> It is not strictly necessary to use numbers,
but probably it is the simplest way to do things. This configurations
would have produced the same results:<p>

<U>search string:</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#006600>"&#60; a > - &#60; b > - &#60; c > - &#60; d > - &#60; e >.mp3"</font><p>
<U>replace string:</U>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<font color=#006600>"&#60; b > - &#60; a > - &#60; c >.mp3"</font><p>

File extensions have to be taken into account, since this window can
be used to rename files of every type, not only mp3 files!
<font color=#0000CC><B>As usual, it is strongly recommended that you use
the "try" button before executing rename operations, to be
sure that the configuration strings you have inserted are correct and
that the result will be what you expect!</B></font><p>
