This window lets you reorganize your mp3 files in directories and
subdirectories with names that are based on the tag values.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Organizer other options</font></h2><p>
You can decide if you want the files to be copied or moved (a much
faster operation).
You can also decide if you want the "advanced tag search" to be applied
when retrieving tag values. The "advanced tag search" window is opened
from the database creator window. Read carefully the help related to
this milestone before applying this options.
