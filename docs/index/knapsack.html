The knapsack algorithm is an optimization algorithm. The problem is
the following one:<p>

you have a certain number of items. Each item has a certain
weight. You also have a knapsack in which you can put in the
items, and this knapsack has a certain maximum weight value. What are
the items that have to be choosen to fill up the knapsack in the best way?

A generalization of this problem is the "multiple knapsack
algorithm". In this case you have more than a single knapsack, and every
knapsack can contain a certian weight of items.
