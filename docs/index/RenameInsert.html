<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Rename Window</font></h1><p>
This window gives you a powerful tool to rename files of every extension.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>String insertion</font></h2><p>
The string written in the <B>"insert"</B> textfield is inserted into the file name at position written in the <B>"position"</B> textfield. Position "0" means the beginning of the file name. <B>Write the word "end" to insert the string at the end of the file name</B> (this for example could be useful if you have lost your file extension because you made a configuration mistake and you didn't press the "try" button before the "execute" button!). If the position number is higher than the file name length, an error will be given in the warning panel. Spaces are accepted and inserted as normal characters.<p>
