<h1 align=center><font color=#ff6600>Advanced Database Window</font></h1><p>
Suppose that you have already a lot of CD with your mp3 songs. You
want to use "Mp3 Studio" to create your database, but you couldn't use
this program before so you know that some songs have no tags,
and you could think that you are lost because this program will put an
empty value in your "artist", "title" or "album" columns. You are
wrong.<p>
The advanced search window gives you the power to retrieve some
information from the file name or from the folder name in which the
file is contained, and will let you decide if these information have
to be retrieved from the file names or the folder names before reading
the tag values.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Artist Advanced Search Options</font></h2><p>
I will describe you the artist panel, because the others are very similar.
You can first decide if the advanced search has to be applied for the
artist field. If you are sure that all your mp3 are tagged probably
you don't need to use the advanced search panel.<p>
Then you can decide if the "artist" field has to be retrieved with the
advanced search before tags are read (checkbox selected), or after it
(checkbox unselected).<p>
The last choice exists only for the artis field: it asks you if in the
retrieved artist field you want the leading word "the " to be
cut. When your collection will become huge, you will discover that you
will have some songs of "Beatles" and other songs of "The Beatles",
some songs of "Cranberries" and some songs of "The Cranberries" ... you
can cut the leading "The" to avoid this (probably undesired) thing.<p>

<h2><font color=#ff6600>Artist Advanced Search String Matches</font></h2><p>
The mechanism is very similar to the one I described to you before
talking about the tag by name window, so I strongly recommend you to
read that paragraph again. All you have to do is inserting all the
possible formats in which the files can be found. Let's make a quite
complex, but easy to understand, example.<p>
Suppose that when you have a full album you always have files in the
following format:<p>

<font color=#006600>"track - artist - title" (ex. "01 - U2 - Where the streets have no name")</font><p>

The folder name in which you put the files belonging to the same album has the following name format:<p>

<font color=#006600>"artist - album" (ex. "U2 - The Joshua Tree")</font><p>

This is true when you have full albums. Sometimes you have
compilations you made by yourself, so in that case you didn't insert
track numbers in file names. So the format of that kind of songs is
the following one:<p>

<font color=#006600>"artist - title" (ex. "Inxs - Need you tonight")</font><p>

These files are put in a directory with a simple name:<p>

<font color=#006600>"Compilation"</font><p>

So, summarizing up the things, the possible file name formats are the following:<p>

<font color=#006600>"track - artist - title"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"artist - title"</font><p>

... and the possible folder name formats are the following ones:<p>

<font color=#006600>"artist - album"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"album"</font><p>

Now look at the artist advanced window. You can retrieve the "artist" name by the folder name or the file name in three different ways:<p>

<font color=#006600>"trash - artist - trash"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><U>source:</U><font color=#006600> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"file name"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"artist - trash"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><U>source:</U><font color=#006600> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"file name"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"artist - trash"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><U>source:</U><font color=#006600> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"folder name"</font><p>

As you should have learned before, "trash" is a field of no
interest. Since we are only interested to the "artist" field, every
other field is "trash". Note that the order of the strings is very
important: the search is performed in the same order you put the
strings in the table, from the first string to the last one. So the
folder name will be considered to retrieve "artist" value only if all
the previous searches have failed. The order is very important also for
another reason. Let's make an example. Suppose that you inserted the
strings not in the above (correct) order, but in the following
order:<p>

<font color=#006600>"artist - trash"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><U>source:</U><font color=#006600> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"file name"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"trash - artist - trash"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><U>source:</U><font color=#006600> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"file name"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"artist - trash"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><U>source:</U><font color=#006600> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"folder name"</font><p>

Now suppose that you are creating a database. The file name considered
is the following one:<p>

<font color=#006600>"01 - U2 - Where the streets have no name"</font><p>

Suppose that this file has no tags, so "Mp3 Studio" applies the advanced
search. The first match string is considered:<p>

<font color=#006600>"artist - trash"</font><p>

This search string applied to the above file name, gives the following results:<p>

<font color=#006600>artist: "01"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>trash:  "U2 - Where the streets have no name"</font><p>

... and this is obviously wrong! <B><font color=#0000CC>The error lies on the order the
"match strings" have been put in the table. Follow this rule and you
will never make mistakes: always put the match strings with the higher
number of fields before the others.</font></B> In our case, you had to put the
string with the three fields before the other one, as I did before.
Obviously, if you have files with different name formats, for
example:<p>

<font color=#006600>"01 - U2 - Where the streets have no name"</font><p>

and:<p>

<font color=#006600>"U2 - 03 - Desire"</font><p>

... I cannot solve you the problem ... you had to rename the files all
in the same format, or you had to tag all your files ... you can in
any case change the settings and configurations to apply it to the
file names of the selected directory, than you change the settings,
select another directory and produce a new database and so on ...<p>

Now let's finish our example. The match strings for the album name:<p>

<font color=#006600>"trash - album"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><U>source:</U><font color=#006600> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"folder name"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"album"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><U>source:</U><font color=#006600> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"folder name"</font><p>

(look at the order ... the string with 2 fields is put before the one with 1 field!)<p>

The match strings for the title name are the following:<p>

<font color=#006600>"trash - trash -
title"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><U>source:</U><font
color=#006600>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "file name"</font><p>
<font color=#006600>"trash - title"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><U>source:</U><font color=#006600> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"file name"</font><p>
